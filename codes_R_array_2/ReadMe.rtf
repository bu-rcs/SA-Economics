This file demonstrate the steps on how to use `array` to more efficiently submit batch jobs (with a R example)

1). Log onto scc through your terminal with codes: ssh Your_Name@scc1.bu.edu

2). Upload your batch file and R codes to clusters (e.g. using FileZilla)

3). Run your batch with codes: qsub -P econdept batch_example.sh

4). You will receive an example when your task is done. Check your folder with the log file and other documents you chose to export
