This file demonstrate the steps on how to use `array` to more efficiently submit batch jobs (with a R example)

## Purpose:

### Scenario 1:
* 100 data files all in the same directory, called “data_NN.csv”
    * i.e. data_00.csv, data_01.csv…etc…
* You want to run a Matlab analysis script for each data file.

### Scenario 2:
* You have a number of Matlab scripts to run, or want to run 1 script multiple times
    * Maybe you’re running simulations or doing a grid search over model parameters.



1). Log onto scc through your terminal with codes: ssh Your_Name@scc1.bu.edu

2). Upload your batch file and R codes to clusters (e.g. using FileZilla)

3). Run your batch with codes: qsub -P econdept batch_example.sh

4). You will receive an example when your task is done. Check your folder with the log file and other documents you chose to export
