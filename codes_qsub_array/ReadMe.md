**This file demonstrate the steps on how to use `array` to more efficiently submit batch jobs (with a R example)**

## Purpose:

### Scenario 1:
* 100 data files all in the same directory, called “data_NN.csv”
    * i.e. data_00.csv, data_01.csv…etc…
* You want to run a R analysis script for each data file.

### Scenario 2:
* You have a number of R scripts to run, or want to run 1 script multiple times
    * Maybe you’re running simulations or doing a grid search over model parameters.

**The two subfolders above are two examples to address how to deal with the two scenarios.**
